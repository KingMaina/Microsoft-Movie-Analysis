## Overview

This project analyzes movie data to provide recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio. The analysis focuses on the following questions:

- What are the most popular movie genres?
- What is the average budget for each genre?
- What is the average revenue for each genre?
- What is the average return on investment for each genre?
- What is the average runtime for each genre?
- What is the average rating for each genre?
- What is the average number of votes for each genre?
- What studios have the highest average return on investment/ gross revenue?

## Business Problem

Microsoft is creating a new movie studio, and they want to know what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. They have asked us to explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

## Data

The data used in this analysis comes from the following sources:

- Box Office Mojo
- IMDB

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis to explore the data and answer the questions posed above. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

- The analysis shows that the most popular movie genres are Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi and Drama.
- Domestic gross sales for movies is typically around `1.4 million dollars` in domestic markets and `18.7 million dollars` in foreign markets.

## Recommendations

1. Microsoft should consider creating movies in the `Action`, `Drama`, `Adventure` and `Sci-Fi` as those receive high gross return in both domestic and foreign markets.
2. Microsoft should invest in high budget movies because movies that performed well and had high returns were from high budget studios such as `Buena Vista (BV)`, `Warner Bros. (WB)` and `Dreamworks` who are well known for creating best selling movies.
3. Microsoft should create movies with an average runtime of around `100 minutes`as this is the most commom watch time as per majority of other movies.

## Problems and Limitations

- The data used in this analysis is limited to between 2010 and 2018.
- The data used in this analysis is limited to movies released in the United States.
- The data used in this analysis is limited to movies that have a listed genre and revenue.

## Improvements

1. Explore datasets with production budgets to make compoarisons with the gross sales.
2. Information on best perfoming actors and directors may help know which who can help positively influence the performance of a movie so that Microsoft can know who to work with when the opportunity comes.
